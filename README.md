# Attack Modifier Basics

### This plugin is basically a cosmetic-only simple implementation of how this could work.

### Usage

<p align="center">
  <a href="#"><img width="500" height="500" src="none for now"></a>
</p>


-> /at /am /snoospawn

-> use /at with no params for help and usage

-> /at [gadget/item/monsterID] [radiusFromSelf] [heightFromSelf] [count] [spread] [rotX] [rotY] [rotZ]

-> /at none (to reset)

-> /at clear (to remove all present gadgets,items spawned by this plugin)

-> /at config (to load from config.json in plugin folder)
 
 You may get hit by your own attacks.

### Issues
-> right now u need to stop the server to save the config file, meaning u cannot edit it while the server is running else it wldnt save.

-> the server might overload with the amt of gadgets spawned since the gadget cannot be removed in certain cases

-> if ur pc/laptop/dick fries due to u being retard and set 1 million gadgets per basic atk, u are own ur own and its 100% ur fault.

## Installation

 Get latest AttackModifier.jar release from [releases](https://github.com/snoobi-seggs/AttackInfusedWithItem/releases) and place it in your `\grasscutter\plugins` folder.
 
 Restart the server if it was already running.
